# Repository Categorization

EclipseSource is involved in several open-source projects and hosts many repositories.
While some of them contain production-ready code or frameworks, others are proof-of-concept implementations or demonstrators.
To help you better understand the purpose and what to expect from each repository, we categorize them with the categories below.

Don't hesitate to [contact us](https://eclipsesource.com/about/contact-us/) if you need active development, maintenance or long term support for a specific project, independently of its state.

## Ready for Production

Repositories that are or have been ready for production, can have one of the following categories.

| Category           | Badge | Description |
|--------------------|-------|-------------|
| Active Development | [![Project - Active Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Active-2ea44f)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that is under active development. The maintainers of this repository are actively developing new features and releasing new versions. |
| Feature Complete   | [![Project - Feature Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Complete-2e85a4)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that is considered to be feature complete. Thus, the maintainers are currently not actively developing new features. |
| Maintenance        | [![Project - Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Maintenance-872ea4)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that is in maintenance mode. The maintainers will focus on issues relevant to their adoption use cases only. |
| Deprecated        | [![Project - Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Deprecated-a42e51)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that is deprecated. The authors will not spend further effort on development or fixes. |

## Other purposes

Repositories that have a purpose other than being used in production, are classified as follows.

| Category               | Badge | Description |
|------------------------|-------|-------------|
| Proof of Concept | [![Aim - PoC](https://img.shields.io/badge/Aim-PoC-a45b2e)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that was/is used to evaluate the feasibility of a certain concept or served as a one time demonstration. The purpose of this PoC is not to provide usable software. Consequently, the authors do not actively ensure that the PoC runs as expected and don't plan to support different set-ups or environments. Until stated otherwise, the authors do not intend to maintain this PoC, apply security fixes, update dependencies, fix issues or provide more documentation. Please feel free to browse the code although it is not meant as a blueprint, i.e. there might be expected and undocumented architectural shortcomings or workarounds. |
| Demonstrator   | [![Aim - Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Aim-Demo-cfc53c)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that was/is used to demonstrate a specific feature on a documented demo path. It is not meant to be used in production or as a template. Consequently, the authors do not actively ensure that anything other than the demo path works and don't plan to support different set-ups or environments. Until stated otherwise, the authors do not intend to apply security fixes, update dependencies, fix issues or provide more documentation. Please feel free to browse the code although it is not meant as a blueprint, i.e. there might be expected and undocumented architectural shortcomings or work around. |
| Blueprint        | [![Aim - Blueprint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Aim-Blueprint-3ca7cf)](https://github.com/eclipsesource/.github/blob/main/repository-classification.md) | A repository that is meant as a template for how specific things can be built. It is not meant to be used as a productive framework or product. Consequently, there may be missing features or bugs. There may even be known bugs that won’t be fixed, if fixing them doesn’t necessarily avail the purpose of this blueprint. |
